title: My Tesco clubcard

I think that tesco requiring a clubcard to get basic offers is silly.  I therefore present to you the universal Tesco Clubcard:

Here is a picture of the QR code (barcode image) to share:

Everyone on the internet is welcome to scan this code to get offers, give points, take points, or anything else.  Consider it one big shared clubcard!

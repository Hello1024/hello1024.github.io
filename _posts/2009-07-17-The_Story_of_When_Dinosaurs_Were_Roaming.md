    <p>Here's a poem I've liked for many years, and when I found out
     that not one of the billions of web pages on the internet include
     even a reference to the poem I decided to publish it here for safe keeping.
     (note I can't be sure of the copyright status of the poem, but feel free to
     contact me if you are the rightful owner)</p>

      <h1>The Story of When Dinosaurs Were Roaming</h1> 
      
A hundred years ago
in what is now Wyoming
Midst Mesozoic jungle swamps
The dinosaurs were roaming.

Some fed upon the leafy plants
That grew along the shore,
While some ate those who ate the plants,
Then looked around for more.

Some walked upon all fours, as you'd
Expect of such a beast.
Some walked two-legged, like a man.
There all resemblance ceased.

A few were small as dog or cat,
But most were quite enormous.
Take BRONTOSAURUS, EIGHTY FEET
In length, as books inform us.

So big was Brontosaurus that
One brain would not suffice.
Besides the wee one in his head He had, and this was nice,
Another brain, or bunch of nerves
Placed rather near the rear
That doubtless had the duties of
Assistant engineer.

And when an enemy drew near,
This Brontosaurus slid
Into the water hurriedly
And there he wisely hid.

Who was this enemy he feared?
Why was it that he fled him?
Well, it was ALLOSAURUS, and
He had a right to dread him.

For Allosaurus, huge and high
On two hind feet went zipping.
His toes were tipped with hooklike nails
That badly needed clipping.

His bite was very special too
His jaws were chomping whizzers.
His lower teeth and uppers worked
Much like the blades of scissors.

He munched and crunched and crunched and munched
With monstrous appetite,
And those who fled him did not wish
A bit to be a bite.

"Look out, look out for Allosaur!"
Each creature warned his friend.
Should any stumble as they ran,
Too bad - that was the end.

TRICERATOPS was well equipped 
With horns. His numbered three,
One on his nose's tip and two
Where eyebrows ought to be.

And as for shield, to shield his neck
From those who tried to grab it
He had a fancy bony frill
He wore from force of habit.

What took the pleasure out of life
For every living thing?
TYRANNOSAURUS REX. (The "rex"
Means he was boss, or king.)

A tyrant was Tyrannosaurus, 
Forever seeking food.
The others, though they loved to chew,
Weren't fond of being chewed.

And so this tyrant rex made wrecks 
Of beasts both fatter, thinner
He grabbed them firmly with his teeth
And hauled them off for dinner.

His head held high, he looked afar,
And if he chanced to meet you,
He'd say, politely, "Hello, friend
How are you? Pleased to eat you."

We come at last to TRACHODON
Who, ducklike in the face,
Seemed very little like a duck 
In any other place

Except for webbing on his feet,
For wings and such he lacked
He may perhaps have waddled some -
I doubt he ever quacked.

This Trachodon stayed in or near
The water all the time
With every - eager outstretched bill
He slip-stopped through the slime.

He searched, you see, for tender slugs
And cuttlefish and crabs,
All which he ate, along with plants,
In gulps and dibs and dabs.

What made the dinosaurs die out
Despite their strength and size?
Some blame it on their little brains
And lack of enterprise.

Give thought, then, to the dinosaurs,
Whom one no longer dreads.
They used their teeth and used their claws
But didn't use their heads.

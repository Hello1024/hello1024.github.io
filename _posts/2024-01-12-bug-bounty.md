title: Exploit Bounty for my stuff!
---


$1000 reward if you can break into my stuff.    I have a mostly patched laptop, phone, and various other devices.


Rules:

 * You must email me saying "I want the exploit bounty" with your name and get a reply before starting.
   I'll send you some hints (phone numbers, ip addresses, makes and models of devices).
 * You have 30 days to break into stuff.  No physical attacks, but anything online is fair game.
 * If you break in, you will find a file in the root directory called "reward.txt".  Send me that file.  Mess with other stuff and the deal is off.
 * I'll send you $1000 if you succeed.
 * Optionally, I will credit you here.

Just to be clear, this isn't a puzzle where I have hidden a sneaky access route - in fact, I believe my stuff to be secure (no way in), so the way to win is to prove me wrong.

Lots of us have "unique" names on google - ie. every result for your name in quotes refers to a website about you, rather than someone else with your name.

When this is the case, often it's nice to be able to sort the results by which results are good and useful, and which results are simply lists of people or random forum posts you made a decade ago.

The best way to do this is to <a href='http://www.google.co.uk/search?q="Oliver+mattos"'>Search for your name</a> and then pick out <a href='http://www.exeterschool.org.uk/page.aspx?id=1863'> the prized results</a>, and the <a href='http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/portal/page/portallive/40C6B15B379D4C55E0440003BACD17D6'>more prized results</a>, while leaving out the random blog postings.

You'll find that a few links to things you've done like the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wubi_(installer)'>work I've done on the Wubi installer</a> or <a href='http://wubi-installer.org/faq.php'>here</a> will move towards the top of the results list if you mention them on <a href='http://www.omattos.com/'>your own site</a>.

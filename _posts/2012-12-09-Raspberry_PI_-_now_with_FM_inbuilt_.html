title: Raspberry PI - now with FM inbuilt!
---

So you looked down the Raspberry Pi spec sheet but weren't happy they didn't include an FM transmitter?    No worries!  I found it's possible to transmit FM using the clock generator built into the broadcom chipset.   Just hook up a bit of wire as an antenna, and you're good to go.


Code and examples and a mini-explanation of how it works are to be found here:
